        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups glutinous rice aka sticky rice or malagkit</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>2 cups brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 cups coconut milk</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the sticky rice and water in a rice cooker and cook until the 
                rice is ready (we intentionally combined lesser amount of water than 
                the usual so that the rice will not be fully cooked)</li>
            <li>While the rice is cooking, combine the coconut milk with brown sugar and 
                salt in a separate pot and cook in low heat until the texture becomes thick. 
                Stir constantly.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked and the coconut milk-sugar mixture is thick enough,
                 add the cooked rice in the coconut milk and sugar mixture then mix well. 
                 Continue cooking until all the liquid evaporates (but do not overcook).</li>
            <li>Scoop the cooked biko and place it in a serving plate then flatten the surface.</li>
            <li>Share and Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
